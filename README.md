fordrop â€“ Forensic Dropbox
----------------

Building the federated social CERT
Information sharing has proven both important and difficult in the field of
computer forensic analysis. The ability to identify occurrences of electronic
evidence across organization boundaries and making this information accessible
and searchable for a larger community is one of the challenges fordrop is trying to
address. By building a social platform where decentralization, federation and
crowd sourcing are central pieces, fordrop makes it easy and safe to share this
information with your fellow investigators. Fordrop enables crowd-sourcing for IT-
forensics.
